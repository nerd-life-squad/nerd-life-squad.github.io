			<h1>What is DEW? How does it work?</h1>
			<p>DEW, short for () is a new entity that uses collected data from the weather (temperature, humidity, windspeed, solar radiation) and generates music.<p> She communicates what it sees from the data that we're feeding her (her perspective), generates sound, and then you can play and communicate with her trough gesture and create something new together. But be careful, if the day is too warm, she might not be in the mood to play!</p>

			<h1>Can machines have a sensorial experience?</h1>
			<p>Machines don't have a physical presence, but if we feed them the right inputs, they'll have a sensory perception that represents some extent of reality.</p>
